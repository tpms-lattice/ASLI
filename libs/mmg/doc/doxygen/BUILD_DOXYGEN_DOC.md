# Mmg doxygen documentation

## Online documentation
The Doxygen documentation of the last release of Mmg is available on : https://mmgtools.github.io/

## Build locally your own html documentation
You can build the Mmg documentation using the `make doc` command generated by CMake.

For CMake begginers you can follow the next steps:
```
   cd mmg
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make doc
```

By default the Doxygen output is builded by the under the `doc` sub directory of the build directory (so in `build/doc` in the previous example). You can configure the `MMG_DOC_DIR` CMake variable to change the Doxygen output directory.
